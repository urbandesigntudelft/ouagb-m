Rein Geurtsen is an important figure for Dutch urban analysis: as a teach and as an urban designer. This study was made for the munipality of Delft, who wanted to organise a design competition for a run-down area of the old inner city: the Zuidpoortgebied. As an introduction to the design teams and to establish a proper understanding of the area with all the parties, Geurtsen prepared this “urban morphological atlas”. It offers what you might call an illustrated history of the area for professionals: historical maps, analytical drawings, texts and photographs are combined to give insight into the relationship between city form and historical development. In the book, Geurtsen looks at two scale levels: the city as a whole and the Zuidpoort in detail. Here we present a selection from the second scale level.
