This analysis of different parts of Italy is based on a very close reading of regional maps. The time consuming preparation of the drawings is something this study has in common with earlier Italian analyses, although building typology is not considered here. The study draws attention to the nature of occupational patterns outside the cities and recent changes in this field. Please note how aerial photographs are used as a basis for some of the drawings. The quality of the drawings lies not only in the delicacy with which they were made but also in the careful selection of what is shown. Within the different series, there is strict adherence to basic drawing rules; unity of scale, orientation, framing, pen thickness etc. Mentioning this might seem banal, but clarity in the visual presentation of analyses is often very hard to obtain.
