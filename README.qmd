This repository hosts the source of the *Open Urban Analysis Guidebook - Morphology* developed at the Section of Urban Design, Department of Urbanism, TU Delft.

The book is an extensive update of the *Urban Analysis Guidebook: Typomorphology* published in more than two decades ago [@vandenburg2004]. This version is meant to (1) update the content with new developments in the field of urban morphology, (2) provide a more dynamic interface that allows learners to interact with the content, and (3) make the book openly accessible beyond TU Delft.

The first phase of development is currently ongoing with financial support from the [Open Education Stimulation Fund](https://www.tudelft.nl/en/open-science/articles-tu-delft/call-for-proposals-2025) of TU Delft.
