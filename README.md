This repository hosts the *Open Urban Analysis Guidebook - Morphology* developed by the Section of Urban Design at TU Delft. The book is an update of the *Urban Analysis Guidebook: Typo-Morphology* published in the early 2000s. This version is meant to (1) update the content with new developments in the field of urban morphology, (2) provide a more dynamic interface that enables interaction, and (3) make the book openly accessible beyond TU Delft. The first phase of development is currently ongoing with financtial support from the Open Education Stimulation Fund of TU Delft.
